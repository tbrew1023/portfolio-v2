                <h2>Project Summary</h2>
                <p>Backpack barber is a mobile app that is essentially the Uber of barbering. Users choose form a network of mobile barbers who travel to you to cut your hair in the convinience of your home, and the barber can be paid through the app.</p>
                <div style="background-image: url('res/portfolio-images/backpack-barber/bb-logo.png'); background-position: center; background-size: 105%; border-radius: 100%; height: 200px; width: 200px; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; box-shadow: 0px 7px 17px -1px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);"></div>
                <h2>Creative Process</h2>
                <p>I used Axure RP to create this mockup for the app. I chose Axure because other tools such as Adobe XD and Invision lacked the harmony of utility and simplicity that I was looking for. I was able to easily organize visuals layer by layer, and I was pretty happy with the end result. I tried to keep Google's Material Design guidelines in mind, but found that the app started to look more and more like every other UI out there, so I decided to keep the usual material elements while implementing some unique design elements such as scrollable sub-pages, and fullscreen gradients.<p>
                <div style="grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr" class="double-image">
                  <img style="margin: 10px; width: 250px; border-radius: 0px" src="res/portfolio-images/backpack-barber/profile.png" />
                  <img style="margin: 10px; width: 245px; border-radius: 0px" src="res/portfolio-images/backpack-barber/payment.png" />
                  <img style="margin: 10px; width: 250px; border-radius: 0px" src="res/portfolio-images/backpack-barber/message.png" />
                </div>
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>Axure RP is an awesome tool for prototyping, even though it lacks some of the fancier features found in other tools like animations, and interactivity. This at least allowed me to focus primarily on the design more than anything else. Around the time I began working on Backpack Barber, Google's Material design system was incredibly popular. All sorts of websites and apps across multiple platforms were utilizing card interfaces, branding through color, and z-axis manipulation and with good reason. I've been in love with material design for a long time, and my study on the design philosophy can be found <a style="padding: 0px; background: rgba(0,0,0,0); text-decoration: underline; color:rgba(0,0,0,0.6)" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vBvlL7ixT04dreJJVqs7KZhJIW_R8UHc06reqcvzIkI/edit">here</a>, but I have to admit that in it's early form, most apps practicing material design began to look more and more similar. These days we're seeing a revolution in mobile app design in the form of Material 2.0 and it's become even easier to impliment radical and experimental design solutions thanks to Google's Flutter framework. I plan to dive back into Backpack Barber to experiment with new design, and I plan to use Flutter framework to impliment a working application for both Android and iOS.</p>
