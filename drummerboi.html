                <h2>Project Summary</h2>
                <p>Drummerboi is a simple beat machine web app made with JavaScript, HTML, and SASS. You can either click/tap the colored keys to make sounds, or you can tap on the keyboard to play sounds.</p>
                <h2>Creative Process</h2>
                <p>When designing Drummerboi, I asked myself how exactly I can make this interface fun to use, attractive, and simple to understand. I was inspired by some really cool effects I found online with SVG waves in an interface to separate information. I ended up using this technique to separate the keys from the rest of the interface, mostly because I thought it looked pretty bland without the effect. I also used Adobe Animate to create poses for the little bear character. I then had him randomly change poses anytime you click a key to make him dance while you play music. I felt like this feature was incredibly important because it keeps the UI fun and interesting even for people who are just watching someone else use the app. I also made sure to keep an emphasis on which colors I use for the key palletes in order for them to match the sounds they play when you click them.<p>
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>When I was in middle school, my grandma gave me an old piano that used to belong to my granddad before he passed. It was an old Casio from the 80s, and it had a huge selection of key tones and background loops to choose from. Me and my older brother would spend hours putting together beats and  layering loops together with the drum kit options. I built Drummerboi because I wanted to provide a similar experience to everyone, in the form of a fun to use, simple drum machine that you can play with your friends. I plan on adding more dance moves to the character in the center, and I also plan to implement a feature to record loops and share them with your friends.</p>
