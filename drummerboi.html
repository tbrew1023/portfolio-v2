                <h2>Project Summary</h2>
                <p>Drummerboi is a simple beat machine web app made with JavaScript, HTML, and SASS. You can either click/tap the colored keys to make sounds, or you can tap on the keyboard to play sounds. You'll also be able to record your songs and share them with friends over social media.</p>
                <h2>Creative Process</h2>
                <p>When designing Drummerboi, I asked myself how exactly I can make this interface fun to use, attractive, and simple to understand. I was inspired by some really cool effects I found online with SVG waves in an interface to separate information. I ended up using this technique to separate the keys from the rest of the interface, mostly because I thought it looked pretty bland without the effect. I also used Adobe Animate to create poses for the little bear character. I then had him randomly change poses anytime you click a key to make him dance while you play music. I felt like this feature was incredibly important because it keeps the UI fun and interesting even for people who are just watching someone else use the app. I also made sure to keep an emphasis on which colors I use for the key palletes in order for them to match the sounds they play when you click them.<p>
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>Drummerboi is still a work in progress, as I hope to implement a feature to record your beats so you can share them with your friends over social media. I also plan to add a feature where the user can upload their own custom sound pack. I'm extremely excited about Drummerboi and I hope to build a version of it in flutter so it can run on mobile without any of the browser hiccups that tend to occur. I can't wait to see what this project evolves into.</p>
