                <h2>Project Summary</h2>
                <p>Quick Keys (Formerly Luke's Locks) Is a residential, commercial, and automotive locksmith based in St. Louis.</p>
                <h2>Creative Process</h2>
                <p>I was commissioned to build this site Summer of 2018, and it sort of became a playground for me to try out new techniques with CSS and JQuery. One of which was the raining effect in the main banner with the keys and locks. I began to focus a lot on experimentation with this site. I also designed the logo, replacing the old Luke's Lock's logo. I was going for a friendlier looking logo that's inviting, matching the tinderness of the locksmith himself. I tried to maintain that level of approachability throughout the entire site with an emphasis on cool blues, fun animations, and rounded corners, inspired by Google's material design philosophy.<p>
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>Even though this was a bit of a smaller project, I still learned so much about both CSS and JQuery just from messing around with new techniques.</p>
