                <h2>Project Summary</h2>
                <p>Solar System Map is an interactive Javascript-based map of our solar system. Users can toggle between 2 view modes which allow you to see both the comparative speeds at which the planets revolve around the sun, as well as the scope and distance of the planets at scale.</p>
                <h2>Creative Process</h2>
                <p>The project was developed using HTML, CSS, and JQuery. JQuery was used for several interactive effects and animations as well as dynamically adjusting the information section depending on where you're currently hovering. Orbiting animations were done in CSS.<p>
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>This ended up being a really fun project to work on, not only as a way to experiment with different JQuery interactions but also to play around with CSS animations. During this project, I learned a ton about both outer space as well as a few CSS tricks for keyframing.
